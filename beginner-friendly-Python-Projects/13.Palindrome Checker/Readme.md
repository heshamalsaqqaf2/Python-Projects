# Palindrome Checker in Python
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

### For example:

racecar
level
deified
1221
madam
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!

In this project, we'll create an advanced palindrome checker in Python that can handle multiple types of inputs.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries needed

## How it works
The palindrome checker checks for palindromes in the following types of inputs:

Strings
Numbers
Lists

For strings and numbers, the program checks if the input is the same forward and backward. For lists, the program checks if the list is the same forward and backward.


## Conclusion
That's it! Now you can check for palindromes in strings, numbers, and lists using palindrome checker in Python.
