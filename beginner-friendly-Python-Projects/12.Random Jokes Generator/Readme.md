# Random Jokes Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random jokes. The jokes are stored in a separate file, jokes.txt, which contains one joke per line.


# Usage
To generate a random joke, simply run the random_jokes.py script:

### python random_jokes.py

The script will select a random joke from jokes.txt and print it to the console.
